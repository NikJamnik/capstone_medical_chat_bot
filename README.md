# Dermatology QA Chatbot with RAG
This repository contains the code for a Telegram chatbot that answers questions about dermatology using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. It integrates a FastAPI backend with OpenAI’s language models and Pinecone vector database for efficient medical question answering. 
The system is trained on a clinical dermatology textbook to provide expert-level responses to user queries. The chatbot is deployed using Railway (https://railway.com/), enabling easy cloud-based hosting.

## Knowledge base
We use the open-access textbook Clinical Dermatology (https://webicdn.com/sdirmember/14/13336/produk/ClinicalDermatology.pdf) as the primary source of information for the RAG pipeline.
